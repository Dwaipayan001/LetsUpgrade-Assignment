Q-1: What is Time and Space Complexity of the following code :
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + j;
}
Answer: 
Let's consider the time complexity of the first loop is O(n) and for the second loop it's O(m).
So, the total time complexity is : O(n+m) or O(max(n,m)).

Q-2: What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
Answer :
b) X  will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs".
